# Drawbridge

A hardened, classic Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) system for Cisco IOS XE
devices — without relying on Cisco's PKI/Secure ZTP infrastructure.

## Why

Classic ZTP is simple but insecure. Cisco's Secure ZTP (RFC 8572) fixes that,
but requires trusting Cisco's MASA service and PKI as a third party —
incompatible with a fully airgapped deployment. Drawbridge takes a third
path: it hardens classic ZTP using infrastructure the organization already
controls.

- Kea DHCP pre-authorisation gate (lease withheld until Drawbridge approves)
- Serial number / client-id allowlisting
- HTTPS script delivery with server certificate validation inside the script
- SHA-256 hash verification of images and config payloads

Drawbridge is **not** an inventory management system — device serials/MACs
are only tracked for the brief window between registration and
provisioning, then dropped in favor of a retention-bounded provisioning log.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for running the app locally,
building the container, and the full list of environment variables.

## Development

Don't `pip install` the `drawbridge` package itself — there's no
`[build-system]` in `pyproject.toml`, and the inner `drawbridge/` directory
isn't a valid setuptools project root on its own. Just run `pytest` from the
repo root; `pythonpath = ["."]` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in
`pyproject.toml` puts the repo root on `sys.path` so `tests/conftest.py` can
`import drawbridge` without an install.

`scripts/dev.sh` starts a full frontend dev session (Flask backend + Vite
dev server with HMR) in one command — see [docs/frontend.md](docs/frontend.md)
for the manual two-terminal workflow it wraps.
