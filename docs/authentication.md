# Authentication

Drawbridge's management UI/API (device allowlist CRUD, script management,
user management) requires an authenticated operator session. Devices and Kea
are unaffected — `/api/lease-event`, `/api/provision-complete`, and the
device-facing `/scripts/<filename>` fetch stay unauthenticated, gated only by
network isolation per the threat model in [architecture.md](architecture.md).

**Flask-Login** owns session/identity (`LoginManager`, `current_user`,
`@login_required`, `UserMixin` on the `User` model — see
[database.md](database.md)). It was chosen over a batteries-included
extension like Flask-Security-Too because it has no opinion about *how* a
user is authenticated — it only tracks who is currently logged in. That
separation matters here: local logins call `check_password_hash()` against
`User.password_hash` and then `login_user()`; a future SAML login validates
the IdP assertion and then calls the same `login_user()`. Passwords are
hashed with Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash`/`check_password_hash`
(already a Flask dependency — no new password library needed).

Local and SAML authentication are intended to coexist indefinitely, not
SAML-replaces-local — `User.auth_source` distinguishes them and
`password_hash` stays nullable for SAML-only accounts.

## User management and account lifecycle

Two roles: `admin` and `operator`. Operators can do everything except manage
other accounts — they have no access to `/api/users`. Only admins can create
accounts, change roles, or delete accounts.

**First admin** — bootstrapped on first startup (see
[decisions.md](decisions.md) / `alpha.md`): username `admin`, a random
password printed to stdout once.

**Subsequent accounts** — an admin creates a user with just a username and a
role via `POST /api/users`. No password is set at creation time
(`password_hash` stays `NULL`, `auth_source='local'`). The account is
unusable via `/login` in this state — `login()` treats a null
`password_hash` as invalid credentials for both this case and SAML-only
accounts, so the two must not be conflated.

The first person to `POST /api/auth/claim` with that username and a new
password sets it, filling in `password_hash`. This is deliberately
passwordless-until-claimed rather than a temp-password/token flow: simpler,
and accepted as a known tradeoff — since only admins create accounts on an
internal, network-isolated deployment, the account-takeover race (someone
else claiming the username first) is treated as low risk for alpha. Revisit
if Drawbridge's threat model changes (e.g. self-service signup, exposure
beyond the isolated network).

Once claimed, a user changes their own password later via
`POST /api/auth/change-password` (requires their current password). There is
no separate admin-triggered password reset in alpha — an admin who needs to
let a user re-claim their account deletes and recreates it.

**Deletion** — an admin can delete any other account via `DELETE
/api/users/<id>` without needing that user's password. Deleting or demoting
(via `PUT /api/users/<id>`) the last remaining admin is rejected, so the
system can never end up with zero admins.

## Planned: SAML SP integration

Not implemented yet. When added:
- `python3-saml` (OneLogin's toolkit) will handle SP metadata, the
  `AuthnRequest`, and assertion validation — there's no need for a
  Flask-specific SAML extension on top of Flask-Login.
- New routes in `drawbridge/api/auth.py`: `GET /saml/metadata` (SP metadata
  for IdP configuration), `GET /saml/login` (redirect to IdP), `POST
  /saml/acs` (Assertion Consumer Service — validates the assertion, upserts
  the `User` row keyed on `saml_issuer`+`saml_subject`, calls `login_user()`).
- SP certificate/key and IdP metadata will be config, not hardcoded, mounted
  similarly to how `/app/scripts` is mounted today.
- `requirements.txt` will pick up `python3-saml` only once this is actually
  built, not speculatively now.
