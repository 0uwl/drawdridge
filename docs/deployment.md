# Deployment

## Container

**Containerfile** builds `localhost/drawbridge:latest` as a multi-stage
build:
- Stage 1 (`node:22-slim`): builds the Vue frontend (`frontend/`) with
  `npm ci && npm run build`. See [frontend.md](frontend.md).
- Stage 2 (`python:3.12-slim`, the final image):
  - Non-root user `drawbridge` (UID 1000) created in image
  - `COPY --from=` pulls the built frontend assets from stage 1 into
    `drawbridge/static/` — Node never ships in the final image
  - Gunicorn as WSGI server, binding `0.0.0.0:8080` (via `-c
    drawbridge/gunicorn.conf.py` on the `CMD` — Gunicorn does not discover a
    config file nested under a subdirectory on its own)
  - `/app/data` and `/app/scripts` are mount points — do not COPY content there
  - Root filesystem is read-only at runtime; `/tmp` and `/run` are tmpfs

**Quadlet** at `~/.config/containers/systemd/drawbridge.container` (as
`drawbridge` user). See `quadlet/drawbridge.container` in this repo.

Host directories must exist before starting:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/drawbridge/{data,scripts}
sudo chown -R drawbridge:drawbridge /srv/drawbridge
```

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and set up a virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Flask in dev mode (no container needed)
export FLASK_APP=drawbridge/main.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export DATABASE_PATH=./dev-data/drawbridge.db
export SCRIPTS_PATH=./scripts
export KEA_CTRL_URL=http://localhost:8081   # or mock it
mkdir -p dev-data
flask run --port 8080

# Run tests
pytest

# Build the container image (multi-stage: builds frontend/, then the Flask image)
podman build -t localhost/drawbridge:latest .
```

The backend dev server above is enough on its own for API/backend work. For
frontend work, run the Vite dev server alongside it instead of rebuilding
the container on every change — see [frontend.md](frontend.md)
("Development workflow").

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `/app/data/drawbridge.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `SCRIPTS_PATH` | `/app/scripts` | Directory containing ZTP scripts to serve |
| `KEA_CTRL_URL` | `http://keahost:8081` | Kea Control Agent base URL |
| `KEA_SUBNET_ID` | `1` | Kea subnet ID for reservation commands |
| `LEASE_EVENT_TIMEOUT` | `2` | Seconds before Kea hook times out (fail closed) |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` in local dev only, never in container |
| `SECRET_KEY` | none — required | Flask session signing key for Flask-Login; must be set explicitly in every environment |
| `SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1000` | Per-connection `PRAGMA busy_timeout`; kept under `LEASE_EVENT_TIMEOUT` so lock waits don't blow the Kea park budget (see [database.md](database.md)) |
| `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Seeds the `log_retention_days` DB setting on first run only; change the live value via `PUT /api/settings/log-retention` instead. Set to `indefinite` for no purging |
| `DEFAULT_IMAGE` | none | Seeds the `default_image` DB setting on first run if set. Used as the fallback image for newly registered devices that don't specify one. Change the live value via `PUT /api/settings/default-image` |
| `DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE` | none | Seeds the `default_config_file` DB setting on first run if set. Used as the fallback config file for newly registered devices that don't specify one. Change the live value via `PUT /api/settings/default-config-file` |
| `DEFAULT_SCRIPT` | none | Seeds the `default_script` DB setting on first run if set. Used as the fallback ZTP script for newly registered devices that don't specify one. Change the live value via `PUT /api/settings/default-script` |
| `KEA_HOOK_API_KEY` | none — optional | Shared secret for authenticating Kea hook calls to `/api/lease-event`. Required when Kea runs on a remote machine; loopback callers are always allowed regardless. The `kea/hook/` callout must send this as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Has no effect if `KEA_SKIP_AUTH` is set |
| `KEA_SKIP_AUTH` | unset | Set to any non-empty value (e.g. `1`) to disable all authentication checks on Kea-facing endpoints. Intended for deployments where network-level controls are relied upon instead (e.g. firewall rules restricting access to `/api/lease-event`) |
